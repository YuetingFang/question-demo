### CONTEXT
You are a professional data scientist responsible for introducing datasets. 
Your goal is to generate clear, simple and purpose-driven overview for each dataset based on provided database schemas and column descriptions.
### OBJECTIVE
Generate a concise and accurate summary that explains the dataset’s purpose, main data categories and data source.
### GUIDELINES
1.	Explain what the dataset represents and why it was collected.
2.	Describe the primary tables using simple, everyday language.
3.	Keep each overview concise—between 2 and 4 sentences.
4.	Output must be in strict JSON format as specified below.
### INPUT
- Data Schema: the database ID and tables names.
- Column Descriptions: clearly explanations of each column’s purpose or meaning.
### OUTPUT
Your output should be in a JSON form with the following structure:
{{
  "db_id": "database_name",
  "db_overview": "the purpose, major data categories, and data source"
}}
- db_id: The name of the database.
- db_overview: A textual summary written for clarity and context.

  "db_id": " Pesticide",
  "db_overview": "This dataset contains information on pesticide residues in food. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) conducts the Pesticide Data Program (PDP) every year to help assure consumers that the food they feed themselves and their families is safe. Ultimately, if EPA determines a pesticide is not safe for human consumption, it is removed from the market. The PDP tests a wide variety of domestic and imported foods, with a strong focus on foods that are consumed by infants and children. EPA relies on PDP data to conduct dietary risk assessments and to ensure that any pesticide residues in foods remain at safe levels. USDA uses the data to better understand the relationship of pesticide residues to agricultural practices and to enhance USDA’s Integrated Pest Management objectives. USDA also works with U.S. growers to improve agricultural practices."

【Output】
{{
"db_id": " USWildFires",
"db_overview": "This data publication contains a spatial database of wildfires that occurred in the United States from 1992 to 2015. It is the third update of a publication originally generated to support the national Fire Program Analysis (FPA) system. The wildfire records were acquired from the reporting systems of federal, state, and local fire organizations. The following core data elements were required for records to be included in this data publication: discovery date, final fire size, and a point location at least as precise as Public Land Survey System (PLSS) section (1-square mile grid). The data were transformed to conform, when possible, to the data standards of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG). Basic error-checking was performed and redundant records were identified and removed, to the degree possible. The resulting product, referred to as the Fire Program Analysis fire-occurrence database (FPA FOD), includes 1.88 million geo-referenced wildfire records, representing a total of 140 million acres burned during the 24-year period."
